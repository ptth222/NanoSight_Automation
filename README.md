NanoSight Automation
=============

NanoSight Automation is a program written in Python 3.6 to coordinate the functions of a NanoSight NS300 instrument and a MVX 7100 autosampler for the purpose of automating NanoSight sample acquisition and analysis. This is done by detecting certain “signals” from each of the individual machine’s control programs and programmatically moving and clicking the mouse as necessary to acquire and analyze each sample. 

The program was developed specifically for the Center for Environmental and Systems Biochemistry (CESB) at the University of Kentucky (UK). If it is desirable to use the program outside of that context then modification may be necessary.
